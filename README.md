# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Analysis Using Machine Learning
## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in females [1]. The disease typically arises from the epithelial lining of the ducts or lobules in the breast, and its progression involves a series of cellular and molecular alterations. One critical aspect of this progression is the transformation of normal breast epithelial cells into malignant cells, a process often characterized by changes in nuclear morphology. Nuclear morphometric features—such as size, shape, chromatin distribution, and nucleolar characteristics—play a pivotal role in the histopathological diagnosis of breast cancer. Numerous studies have demonstrated that alterations in these nuclear features are closely associated with tumor grade and patient prognosis [2][3]. As such, quantitative nuclear morphometry has emerged as a valuable and objective tool for distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions.

The increasing availability of digitized medical data made possible the integration of computational methods in cancer diagnosis. Data science and machine learning techniques offer robust frameworks for analyzing high-dimensional datasets, enabling the discovery of patterns and predictive biomarkers that may not be evident through conventional analysis. These approaches hold a major potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, guiding treatment decisions, and improving patient outcomes [4].

In this project, we perform a comprehensive analysis of a breast cancer dataset, focusing on three main components: exploratory data analysis, unsupervised clustering using K-means, and supervised predictive modeling. Through this multi-stage approach, I aim to uncover meaningful patterns in the data and develop models capable of accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant tumor cells.

## Project Objective

### Research Question:

Can we utilize morphometric features of breast cell nuclei to effectively distinguish between benign and malignant tumors using data science techniques?

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This first step involves a thorough statistical and visual investigation of the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns within the features.

### 2. K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
In the second step, we apply the K-means clustering algorithm to assess whether the dataset's structure naturally separates into distinct groups corresponding to malignant and benign tumors—without using the diagnosis labels.

### 3. Predictive Modeling (Supervised Learning)
The final step focuses on building and evaluating models to predict tumor classification.
